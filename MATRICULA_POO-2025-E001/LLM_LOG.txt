LLM usage log – Practical Exercise E001

The LLM was used as a support tool during the development of this project, mainly for:

- Clarifying Object-Oriented Programming concepts discussed in class (encapsulation, constructors, and business methods).
- Reviewing the exercise statement to ensure all required rules and constraints were correctly implemented.
- Assisting with debugging compilation and execution issues on Windows (compiler setup and environment configuration).
- Improving code organization, readability, and documentation comments.

All implementation decisions, class structures, and business rules were fully understood, reviewed, and adapted by the student.
The final code was manually written, tested, and validated by the student.
